# Rotating Magnetic Field Animation
This repository contains MATLAB code that animates the generation of a rotating magnetic field produced by three coils. The code simulates the magnetic fields generated by each coil and visualizes the resultant rotating field, demonstrating the fundamental principles of rotating magnetic fields in electromagnetism. The animation provides an educational tool for understanding how alternating currents in three-phase coils create a continuous rotation of the magnetic field, a concept essential in the operation of electric motors and generators. Explore the code to see the dynamic behavior of the magnetic field and gain insights into electromagnetic theory.
